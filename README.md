A2billing Jquery UI interfaces - Customer interface
===================================================

Custom UI templates using the Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 API + Jquery to enhance A2billing UI templates.
I was looking for a clean design, reusable, liquid layout / table less, open source and easy to implement solution. 
For sure there are many other options/frameworks, but I dediced to give it a try to Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 + Jquery 
You will need to overwrite some files on your exiting A2Billing instance. Please notice that basically we add:
-References to css and js
-Css and js files it self.
The important detail is that these files do not override at all the PHP code, so you will have exactly the same code plus a nicer UI interface.
Check that new versions or A2billing are comming that will implement Twitter bootstrap.
